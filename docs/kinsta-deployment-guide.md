# WeeBunz Quiz Engine Deployment Guide for Kinsta

## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying the WeeBunz Quiz Engine to Kinsta hosting. The quiz engine has been optimized to handle hundreds to thousands of concurrent users with the following features:

- Redis cache integration for improved performance
- Enhanced session handling for concurrent users
- Database optimization with proper indexes
- API rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- Performance monitoring and metrics
- Kinsta-specific optimizations

## Prerequisites

Before deploying to Kinsta, ensure you have:

1. A Kinsta hosting account with access to MyKinsta dashboard
2. WordPress site created on Kinsta
3. SFTP access credentials for your Kinsta site
4. The WeeBunz Quiz Engine deployment package (`weebunz-quiz-engine.zip`)

## Step 1: Prepare Kinsta Environment

1. Log in to your MyKinsta dashboard at https://my.kinsta.com/
2. Navigate to your WordPress site or create a new one
3. Go to the "Tools" section and enable Redis cache
4. Ensure PHP version is set to 7.4 or higher (8.0+ recommended)
5. Verify that the following PHP extensions are enabled:
   - mysqli
   - curl
   - gd
   - xml
   - mbstring
   - zip

## Step 2: Upload and Install the Plugin

### Option 1: Via SFTP

1. Extract the `weebunz-quiz-engine.zip` file on your local computer
2. Connect to your Kinsta site using SFTP with the credentials provided in MyKinsta
3. Navigate to the `wp-content/plugins/` directory
4. Upload the entire `weebunz-quiz-engine` folder to this directory
5. Upload the `object-cache.php` file to the `wp-content/` directory

### Option 2: Via WordPress Admin

1. Log in to your WordPress admin dashboard
2. Navigate to Plugins > Add New > Upload Plugin
3. Select the `weebunz-quiz-engine.zip` file and click "Install Now"
4. After installation, connect via SFTP and upload the `object-cache.php` file to the `wp-content/` directory

## Step 3: Activate and Configure the Plugin

1. In your WordPress admin dashboard, navigate to Plugins
2. Find "WeeBunz Quiz Engine" and click "Activate"
3. After activation, go to WeeBunz > Settings in the admin menu
4. Configure the following settings:
   - Redis Cache: Enable if Redis is available
   - Database Optimization: Run the database optimization
   - API Rate Limiting: Configure limits based on your expected traffic
   - Error Handling: Set notification email for critical errors

## Step 4: Load Sample Data (Optional)

If you want to test with sample data:

1. Go to WeeBunz > Tools in the admin menu
2. Click "Load Sample Data"
3. This will create sample quizzes, questions, and other test data

## Step 5: Configure Kinsta for Optimal Performance

1. In MyKinsta dashboard, go to your site's "Tools" section
2. Enable page caching
3. Configure Kinsta CDN for static assets
4. Set up Redis cache monitoring to track usage
5. Consider enabling server-level caching for non-dynamic pages

## Step 6: Test Deployment

1. Go to WeeBunz > Load Testing in the admin menu
2. Run a load test with a small number of concurrent users (e.g., 10-20)
3. Gradually increase the number of concurrent users to test system limits
4. Monitor performance metrics in the WeeBunz > Performance dashboard
5. Check for any errors or performance bottlenecks

## Step 7: Production Readiness Checklist

Before going live, verify the following:

- [ ] Redis cache is properly configured and working
- [ ] Database tables have all required indexes
- [ ] API rate limiting is properly configured
- [ ] Error handling and notifications are set up
- [ ] Performance monitoring is enabled
- [ ] Load testing shows acceptable performance under expected load
- [ ] Backup system is configured
- [ ] SSL is enabled for secure connections

## Troubleshooting

### Redis Connection Issues

If Redis is not connecting:

1. Verify Redis is enabled in MyKinsta
2. Check that the `object-cache.php` file is in the correct location
3. Verify Redis connection details in the plugin settings

### Performance Issues

If experiencing performance issues:

1. Check Redis cache hit rate in the performance dashboard
2. Verify database queries are using proper indexes
3. Increase PHP memory limit if needed
4. Consider upgrading your Kinsta plan for more resources

### Database Errors

If database errors occur:

1. Run the database optimization again
2. Check for any failed migrations
3. Verify table structure matches expected schema
